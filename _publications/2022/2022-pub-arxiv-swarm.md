  We propose a detection and tracking framework for multi-ant tracking in the videos by: 
  (1) adopting a two-stage object detection framework using ResNet-50 as backbone and coding the
  position of regions of interest to locate ants accurately; (2) using the ResNet model to develop the
  appearance descriptors of ants; (3) constructing long-term appearance sequences and combining
  them with motion information to achieve online tracking.
