  We collect 10 videos of 3 species of ant colonies from different scenes, including 5 indoor and 5 outdoor scenes.
  We develop an image sequence marking software named VisualMarkData, which enables us to provide annotations of the ants in the videos. (i) It offers comprehensive annotations of states at the individual-target and colony-target levels. 
  (ii) It provides a simple matrix format to represent multiple targets and multiple groups of annotations (along with their IDs and behavior labels).
  (iii) During the annotation process, we propose a simple and effective visualization that takes the annotation information of the previous frame as a reference, and then a user can simply click on the center point of each target to complete the annotation task.
   (iv) We develop a user-friendly window-based GUI to minimize labor and maximize annotation quality.
