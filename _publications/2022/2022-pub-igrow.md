  We propose a smart agriculture solution named iGrow, for autonomous greenhouse control (AGC):
  (1) for the frst time, we formulate the AGC problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) optimization problem;
  (2) we design a neural network-based simulator incorporated with the incremental mechanism to
  simulate the complete planting process of an autonomous greenhouse, which provides a testbed for the optimization of control strategies; 
  (3) we propose a closed-loop bi-level optimization algorithm, which can dynamically re-optimize the greenhouse control strategy with newly observed data during real-world production.
  We not only conduct simulation experiments but also deploy iGrow in real scenarios,
  and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of iGrow in autonomous greenhouse simulation and optimal control.
