  We proposed a hive monitoring system, and build a visualization module in the cloud to monitor the activity of bee colonies and the environmental dynamic changes. (1) We proposed a multi-bee tracking algorithm to solve the problem of monitoring bees at the door of the hive; (2) we constructed a dataset containing various complex scenes, named BEE22, for training and testing the performance of our algorithm; (3) we designed a bee counting rule, based on results of multi-bee tracking algorithm, to reasonably count the bees entering or leaving the beehive; (4) we have deployed multiple sensors around(center, margin, door, and environment) the hive to accurately reflect the changes in the environment around the hive.
