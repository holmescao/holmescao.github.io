  We propose a two-stage planning framework to automatically optimize greenhouse control setpoints given specific outside weather conditions. 
  First, we take advantage of cumulative planting data and horticulture   knowledge to build a multi-modular simulator, using neural
  networks to simulate climate change and crop growth in
  the greenhouse. Second, two AI algorithms (reinforcement learning and heuristic algorithm) are applied as
  planning methods to obtain optimal control strategies
  based on the simulator.
