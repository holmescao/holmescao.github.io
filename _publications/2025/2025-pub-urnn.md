abstract: >-
  We propose U-like Recurrent Neural Network (U-RNN), a latent autoregressive architecture,
  to represent the spatiotemporal dynamic process of urban flooding,
  and a Sliding Window-based Pre-warming (SWP) training paradigm to reduce computational demand
  and enhance the generalization of full sequence predictions.
