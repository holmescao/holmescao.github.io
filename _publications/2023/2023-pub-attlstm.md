  This study proposes an attention mechanism-based Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network,
  named as ALSTM-DW, which uses double time sliding windows (DTSW), and a weighted mean square error (WMSE) loss function.
   The ALSTM-DW model was applied to three urban flooding hotspots in Shenzhen, China, 
   and its effectiveness was verified through a series of comparative experiments.
