short_bio: >-
  I am currently a Ph.D. student at Peking University (PKU), under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=4sRgmaIAAAAJ">Prof. Huapeng Qin</a>. 
  Additionally, I am a remote visiting scholar at the University of Edinburgh, working with a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2Np3wJ4AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN">Prof. Alistair Borthwick</a>. 
  Previously, I obtained my M.S. degree from Xiamen University, where I was advised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yxyC-o0AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN">Prof. Xiaoyu Cao</a>, a recipient of the Excellent Young Scientists Fund (EYSF), 
  and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RPAVxiAAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN">Prof. Shihui Guo</a>.
  During my master's studies, I spent a year as an Algorithm Researcher (Intern) at Tencent AI Lab and was rated as an Outstanding Intern,
  under the joint supervision of Senior Engineer <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=n8IjgKkAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN">Dr. Lanqing Li</a>
  and Expert Engineer <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=y_1aniIAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN">Dr. Dijun Luo</a>. 
  I have closely collaborated with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hNO0NdEAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN">Dr. Yao Yao</a> from Tsinghua University and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8cnXnOEAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN">Prof. Guangtao Fu</a> from the University of Exeter.
  <br><br><b>My research mainly focuses on AI for Science, including AI applications in 2D hydrological and hydrodynamic simulations, multi-insect tracking, and greenhouse crop simulations.</b>
  I am dedicated to exploring how to integrate domain knowledge into AI models, aiming to enhance generalization and produce results that are more aligned with physical laws.
  Recently, my focus has been on embedding hydrodynamic knowledge (e.g., shallow water equations) into neural networks to enable general flood modeling, including solving, generalization, and knowledge discovery.
  <br><br>My research has been published in multiple top-tier journals and conferences, such as IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, Pattern Recognition, Journal of Hydrology, AAAI, and ICAPS.
