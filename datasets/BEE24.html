about: "BEE24 includes a total of 36 videos and 446,908 annotations. BEE24 challenges models to track multiple
similar-appearing small objects with complex motions over long periods. It serves as a testbed for MOT research in more
complex and diverse real-world scenes, significantly contributing to tracking general objects, including pedestrians,
vehicles, drones, animals, insects, etc.
The leaderboard of existing trackers, as well as training and testing sequences, can be found in the <a
    href='https://github.com/holmescao/TOPICTrack'>code repository</a> and the <a
    href='https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10851814'>paper</a>."
