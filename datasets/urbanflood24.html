about: "The dataset is a spatial and temporal dynamic simulation of rainfall-induced urban flooding. 
A total of 56 rainfall events, including 20 measured rainfall events and 36 design rainfall events, 
are used to assess urban flooding induced by various rainfall conditions. 
The measured rainfall events are the most severe rainfall events recorded in Shenzhen City, China, 
during the period from 2008 to 2018, with a duration of 6 hours, a rainfall amount of 48-211 mm, 
and a return period of 0.1-20 years. To analyze the potential extreme rainfall risk due to climate change, 
we design some extreme rainfall events based on Chicago storm profiles 
and Shenzhen rainfall intensity-duration-frequency relationships, 
with a duration of 3 h, a return period of 100-500 years, a time-peak ratio range of 0.1-0.9, 
and a data recording frequency of 1 min. 
The flooding spatio-temporal dynamics data are generated by MIKE Plus version 2023 simulation with a recording frequency of 1 min. 
We also provided geo-information data including DSM, drainage inlet area and imperviousness.
Training and testing sequences, can be found in the <a
    href='https://github.com/holmescao/U-RNN'>code repository</a>."
